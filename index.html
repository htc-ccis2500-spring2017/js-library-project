                    <h3>About the Project</h3>
                    <p> I'm creating a videogame from scratch, using a videogame using engine that I bought. Most of the games I play nowadays don't feel fun anymore because they focus too much on fancy graphics, so I am attempting to make something that has that feel of a retro game, with a focus on gameplay which I think is fun. </p>

                    <h3 id="skills">Fun Facts</h3>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>I took a Javascript class and .NET programming class this semester, and used the knowledge to build my game. The language used in the game making engine I have (GML) is very similar to JavaScript</li>
                        <li>I've only had GM2 for about a week, but have created 3 games (2 platform games and an overhead shooter) as practice</li>
                        <li>I bought a graphic tablet and started to learn how to draw sprites and I also bought a program that helps me animate those sprites. I'm leaving the music portion of the game to my brother, who volunteered to make the soundtrack. There is a ton to learn because I don't know anything about making videogames, but it's fun!</li>
                        <li>Tools Used: GameMaker Studio 2, Aseprite, Spriter Pro, ArtRage Lite</li>
                        <li>Languages Used: GML, Javascript (mainly making a Javascript Object Notation list and adding it to a datastructure in the game code)  </li>
                        <li>I started getting into game dev 1 week before 2 finals and 2 projects were due, and ended up blowing up my Javascript Final because I forgot we had one until the last minute! Staying up until 3am everyday while working fulltime sure didn't help either! </li>
